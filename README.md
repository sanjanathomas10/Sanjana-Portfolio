## [Project 1️⃣: Exploratory Electoral Analysis] --> [Click here to access Repository](https://github.com/sanjanathomas10/Electoral_Analysis.git)
This is a project I undertook for my undergraduate degree in Politics and Data Science in where I collected and organised mass amounts of electoral data from the UK into a database and interpreted various electoral insights. <br>
🛠️ Designed and implemented a NoSQL database ecosystem using MongoDB and Neo4j <br> 📈 Queried the database using Python to analyse targeted electoral questions and extract relevant insights.


## [Project 2️⃣: Home Prices Prediction Model] --> [Click here to access Repository](https://github.com/sanjanathomas10/Predicting_Home_Prices.git)

This is a project I undertook as a personal endeavour in where I built a home prices prediction model using home size data using python and regression modelling. <br>
🛠️ Built a linear regression model in Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib) to predict house prices from property size. <br> 📈Evaluated performance using R², MAE, and RMSE, achieving 90% explanatory power. <br> This project showcases skills in data exploration, visualization, machine learning, and model evaluation, all while turning raw housing data into actionable insights for real-estate pricing.
